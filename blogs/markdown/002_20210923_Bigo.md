## Big O 

Notates time and space complexity of code algorithms. Processing tends to vary based variations in computational capacity between machines and on the same machine. 

Big O helps in understanding on how compute capacity will be consumed as utilization of given algothim grows.

Where:

```bash
N = number_of_entries
```
Linear, one iteration per N  

```bash
O(N)
```
